# Shift-Right CDC Operations

The biggest operational challenge for CDC systems is often the challenges in gatting two independent operational 
teams (e.g. z/OS and LUW or cloud ) to form an effective alliance to manage the business service level.

remote capture agents offer the benefit of establishing a single operational control point within the enterprise on Linux or Windows.

IBM sales presentations sometimes promote the benefit of remote capture agenst as saving mainframe CPU cycles. 
Whilst there is some truth in these claims, they are over-rated and not a significant as the importance of having a single operations control plane.
