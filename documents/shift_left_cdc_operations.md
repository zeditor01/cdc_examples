# Shift-Left CDC Operations


The biggest operational challenge for CDC systems is often the challenges in gatting two independent operational 
teams (e.g. z/OS and LUW or cloud ) to form an effective alliance to manage the business service level.

Containerisation within zCX offer the benefit of establishing a single operational control point within z/OS.
