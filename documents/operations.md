# CDC Operations Management

This paper has yet to be written. The following is an indication of the nature of the content that it will address.

CDC Operations (for a well managed environment) is a simple affair of automated starting & stopping of CDC servers, combined with monitoring and alerting.

However, CDC Operations can become much more complex in the case of operational recovery scenarios.

Topics to cover include
1. Simple CDC Operations
2. Understanding the underlying mechanics that operations depends upon ( bookmarks, control tables, operational dependencies etc... )
3. Troubleshooting a CDC scenario where the agents have failed, and they won't restart
