# CDC USe Case Suitability

Every other article in the CDC Worked Examples repository is a factual record of how CDC was implemented for these worked examples. This article is different in that it contains some opinions about when it suitable to use CDC software, and when it is not. 

These are the personal opinions of the author, and will not find agreement with everybody who reads these articles. 
If you have found the worked examples helpful, then I ask you to take a moment to consider these points of view.
