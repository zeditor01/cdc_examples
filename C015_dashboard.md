# CDC Dashboard not using Windows Management Console

The CDC Management Console is a well designed, comprehensive dashboard for CDC.
A number of Enterprises do not want a Windows application as a core operational component of system-automated business-critical systems.
This is no criticism of Windows. The same objection would be raised if the management console was buildin Mac OSX or Linux.
This is no criticism of the Managememt Console. The functionality and ease of use is great.

The issue is the non-functional requirements for management of modern systems.
